This is a semester project 2 for Front-end Development at Noroff.

## Brief

An auction site is looking to launch a website where users can add items to be bid on and bid on items other users have put up for auction.

When a new user joins the website, they are given 1000 credits to use on the site. They can get credits by selling items and use credit by buying items. Non-registered users can search through the listings, but only registered users can make bids on listings.

## Requirements

All API functionality is managed by an existing application. This project only covers the front-end application for the API.

## User stories

The client has specified the following requirements in the form of User Stories:

1. A user with a stud.noroff.no email may register
2. A registered user may login
3. A registered user may logout
4. A registered user may update their avatar
5. A registered user may view their total credit
6. A registered user may create a Listing with a title, deadline date, media gallery and description
7. A registered user may add a Bid to another user’s Listing
8. A registered user may view Bids made on a Listing
9. An unregistered user may search through Listings
